The OpenZeppelin Starter Kit allows you to bootstrap your decentralized application. It optionally includes an interactive tutorial to help you take your first steps in the world of smart contract development.

## How it works

The starter kit works by creating a React application that serves a web user interface.
This interface allows you to interact with your smart contracts via a web3
provider: Metamask, Coinbase Wallet. The interaction is enabled by Truffle and
OpenZeppelin SDK. They work together to compile and test your smart contracts
locally. Eventually, you need to take your application to mainnet, and Infura
is already configured to help you do so effortlessly.

## Features

* Upgrade smart contracts. Fix bugs and security vulnerabilities,
  and introduce new features to your projects without migrating all your data.
* Reuse on-chain code. Reuse on-chain Solidity code that has been vetted by the
  community. Link to on-chain smart contract packages (EVM packages) as
  building blocks for your project, and publish your packages for others to
  use. OpenZeppelin is included in the example.
* Easily connect with Ethereum networks via preconfigured Infura API keys. Use
  Infura to connect and access data from different test-nets and mainnet of
  Ethereum. They provide an easy-to-use API and developer tools to enable
  secure, reliable, and scalable access to Ethereum and IPFS (InterPlanetary
  File System).
* Compile and test smart contracts. The Starter Kit includes the Truffle suite that
  contains a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for
  blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
* Create adaptable and responsive UI components. The Starter Kit includes React
  and Rimble to give you all the components and flexibility you need to build
  responsive user interfaces.
