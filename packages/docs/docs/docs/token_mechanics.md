---

ZeppelinOS is a platform to develop, deploy and operate smart contract projects 
on Ethereum and every other EVM and eWASM-powered blockchain. Its native token, 
ZEP, aligns incentives where required to create a healthy ecosystem of secure 
smart contract projects. Here, we present a summary of ZeppelinOS’s token 
mechanics by first discussing ZEP’s central role in the curated EVM package system, 
and then describing its more direct usage in other parts of the platform.
