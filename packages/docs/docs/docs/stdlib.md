ZeppelinOS provides a way to link your contracts to EVM packages of reusable code. 

One such package is the OpenZeppelin EVM package, which includes some of the most widely used contracts. The code in this EVM package comes from [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org), an extremely well-tested collection of smart contracts that were only slightly modified to adapt them to ZeppelinOS.  

The source code for these contracts can be found in the [`openzeppelin-zos`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-zos/contracts) repository of `OpenZeppelin`.
