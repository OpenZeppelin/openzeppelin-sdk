ZeppelinOS provides a way to link your contracts to on-chain standard libraries of reusable code. 

One such library is the OpenZeppelin stdlib, which includes some of the most widely used contracts. The code in this stdlib comes from [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org), an extremely well-tested collection of smart contracts that were only slightly modified to adapt them to ZeppelinOS.  

The contracts presently included in the OpenZeppelin stdlib are:

- `DetailedMintableToken`
- `DetailedPremintedToken`
- `MintableERC721Token`
- `TokenTimelock`
- `TokenVesting`

The source code for these contracts can be found in the [`zos-release`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/tree/zos-release/contracts) branch of the `OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity` repository.
