title: OpenZeppelin SDK
---

The OpenZeppelin SDK is a platform to develop, deploy and operate smart contract projects
on Ethereum and every other EVM and eWASM-powered blockchain.

## Features

* **Interactive commands**: Send transactions, query balances, and interact with your contracts directly from the command line.
* **Upgrade your contracts**: You can develop your smart contracts iteratively, speeding up development locally, or squashing bugs in production.
* **Link Ethereum Packages**: Use code from contracts already deployed to the blockchain directly on your project, saving gas on deployments and managing your dependencies securely.
* **Build a (d)app**: Jumpstart your dapp by unpacking one of our starter kits, pre-configured with OpenZeppelin Contracts, OpenZeppelin SDK, React, and Infura.

## Getting Started
