`zos-lib` is a library to develop, deploy and operate upgradeable smart contracts on Ethereum and every other EVM and eWASM-powered blockchain.

## Getting Started

To install `zos-lib` simply go to your project's root directory and run:

```sh
npm install zos-lib
```

Next, learn how to:
- [Programmatically develop and deploy a single upgradeable smart contract](low_level_contract.md) (for fixing bugs or adding new features)
- [Programmatically develop and operate a complex upgradeable app](low_level_app.md) with multiple smart contracts which are connected to the [ZeppelinOS upgradeable standard library](stdlib.md)
