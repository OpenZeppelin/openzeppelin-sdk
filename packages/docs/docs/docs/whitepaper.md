Anyone can use open networks like Ethereum to run software and formalize
contractual relationships through code. These decentralized applications often
facilitate some kind of financial exchange for services. However, the
development process to build this kind of software is often complex,
time-consuming, and prone to error.

Ensuring the security of these financial transactions and the funds held in
smart contracts is imperative to the success of the blockchain ecosystem. There
is currently little standardization and no easy way to develop highly secure
applications. Responding effectively to security emergencies is beyond
challenging with current tools.

On the other hand, decentralized networks are not structured to work together,
often needing access to each other’s native tokens to operate, making it hard
to leverage external systems.

To address these issues we propose ZeppelinOS: an open-source, decentralized
platform of tools and services on top of the EVM to securely build and manage
smart contract applications, free of charge.
