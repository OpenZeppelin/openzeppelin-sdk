= OpenZeppelin SDK

The OpenZeppelin SDK is a platform to develop, deploy and operate smart contract projects on Ethereum and every other EVM and eWASM-powered blockchain.

[[features]]
== Features

* *Interactive commands*: Send transactions, query balances, and interact with your contracts directly from the command line.
* *Upgrade your contracts*: You can develop your smart contracts iteratively, speeding up development locally, or squashing bugs in production.
* *Link Ethereum Packages*: Use code from contracts already deployed to the blockchain directly on your project, saving gas on deployments and managing your dependencies securely.
* *Build a (d)app*: Jumpstart your dapp by unpacking one of our starter kits, pre-configured with OpenZeppelin Contracts, OpenZeppelin SDK, React, and Infura.
