Anyone can use open networks like Ethereum to run software and formalize contractual relationships through code. These decentralized applications often facilitate some kind of financial exchange for services. However, the development process to build this kind of software is often complex, time-consuming, and prone to error.

Ensuring the security of these financial transactions and the funds held in smart contracts is imperative to the success of the blockchain ecosystem. There is currently little standardization and no easy way to develop highly secure applications. Responding effectively to security emergencies is beyond challenging with current tools.

On the other hand, decentralized networks are not structured to work together, often needing access to each otherâ€™s native tokens to operate, making it hard to leverage external systems.

To address these issues we propose the OpenZeppelin SDK: an open-source, decentralized platform of tools and services on top of the EVM to securely build and manage smart contract applications, free of charge.
