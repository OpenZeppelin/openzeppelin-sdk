[[building-gsn-powered-dapp]]
= Building a GSN powered (d)app from scratch

In this tutorial, we will integrate several libraries from the SDK, as well as OpenZeppelin Contracts, to build a GSN-powered (d)app. The https://gsn.ethereum.org[GSN], or Gas Station Network, is a decentralized network of relayers that allow you to subsidize your users' transactions. This way, they do not need gas to use your (d)app. You can read more about the GSN https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/gsn[here].

We will use the `create-react-app` package to bootstrap a React application and use the `@openzeppelin/network` package to easily set up a web3 object with GSN support. Also, since the gas station network is not available on your local ganache, we will use the `@openzeppelin/gsn-helpers` package to emulate it locally. We will use the `@openzeppelin/cli` to manage our contracts, and extend from `@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package` to add GSN capabilities to them. 

NOTE: It might feel like there many moving pieces here, but each component has a well-defined role in building this application. That said, if you are new to the OpenZeppelin platform, it may help to look into the https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/gsn[OpenZeppelin Contracts GSN guide] and xref:first.adoc[how to start your first SDK project] before you continue reading.

We will create a super simple contract that just counts transactions sent to it from users but will tie it into the GSN so the users will not have to pay for the gas of those transactions. Let's get started!

[[environment-set-up]]
== Setting up the environment

We will begin by creating a new npm project and install all dependencies.

[source,console]
----
mkdir gsn-dapp && cd gsn-dapp
npm init -y
npm install @openzeppelin/network
npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin/gsn-helpers @openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package @openzeppelin/upgrades
----

Make sure you have the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-sdk/tree/master/packages/cli#readme[OpenZeppelin CLI installed], as well as https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache[Ganache] for running a local network.

[source,console]
----
npm install --global @openzeppelin/cli ganache-cli
----


Use the CLI to set up a new project and follow the prompts so we can write our first contract.

[source,console]
----
openzeppelin init
----


[[creating-our-contract]]
== Creating our contract

We will write our vanilla `Counter` contract in the newly created `contracts` folder.

[source,solidity]
----
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract Counter {
  uint256 public value;

  function increase() public {
    value += 1;
  }
}
----


Simple enough. Let's now modify it to add GSN support. This requires extending from `GSNRecipient` contract and implementing the `acceptRelayedCall` method. This method must return whether we accept or reject to pay for a user transaction. For the sake of simplicity, we will be paying for all transactions sent to this contract.

NOTE: For most (d)apps, it is probably not a good idea to have such a generous policy since any malicious user can easily drain your contract from funds. Check out our https://docs.openzeppelin.com/[guide on GSN payment strategies] for different approaches to this problem.

[source,solidity]
----
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package/contracts/GSN/GSNRecipient.sol";

contract Counter is GSNRecipient {
  uint256 public value;

  function increase() public {
    value += 1;
  }

  function acceptRelayedCall(
    address relay,
    address from,
    bytes calldata encodedFunction,
    uint256 transactionFee,
    uint256 gasPrice,
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint256 nonce,
    bytes calldata approvalData,
    uint256 maxPossibleCharge
  ) external view returns (uint256, bytes memory) {
    return _approveRelayedCall();
  }
}
----

Start ganache on a separate terminal by running `ganache-cli`, and then create an instance of our new contract using the OpenZeppelin CLI with `oz create` and follow the prompts. Take care to copy the address of your instance which is returned at the end of the process.

NOTE: It is important that you remember to call the `initialize()` function when creating the contract, as this will take care to get your contract ready to be used in the GSN.


[source,console]
----
$ openzeppelin create
✓ Compiled contracts with solc 0.5.9 (commit.e560f70d)
? Pick a contract to instantiate Counter
? Pick a network development
All contracts are up to date
? Do you want to call a function on the instance after creating it? Yes
? Select which function * initialize()
✓ Instance created at 0x7F73086E24ce5834E62075dEAB2b8F10865FFF9B
----

Great! Now, if we had deployed this contract to mainnet or the rinkeby testnet, we would almost be ready to start sending gasless transactions to it, since the GSN is set up on both of those networks. However, since we are on a local ganache, we need to set it up ourselves.

[[deploying-local-gsn]]
== Deploying a local GSN for development

The GSN is composed of a central `RelayHub` contract, that coordinates all relayed transactions, as well as multiple decentralized relayers. The relayers are processes that receive requests to relay a transaction via an HTTP interface, and send them to the network via the `RelayHub`.

Having ganache already running, you can start a new relayer in a new terminal using the following command from `@openzeppelin/gsn-helpers`:

[source,console]
----
$ npx oz-gsn run-relayer
Deploying singleton RelayHub instance
RelayHub deployed at 0xd216153c06e857cd7f72665e0af1d7d82172f494
Starting relayer
 -Url http://localhost:8090
...
RelayHttpServer starting. version: 0.4.0
...
Relay funded. Balance: 4999305160000000000
----

NOTE: Under the hood, this command takes care of several steps to have a local relayer up and running. First, it will download a relayer binary for your platform, and start it. It will then deploy the `RelayHub` contract to your local ganache, register the relayer on the hub, and fund it so it can relay transactions. You can run these steps individually by using other `oz-gsn commands`, or even https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-gsn-helpers[directly from your code].

The last step will be to _fund_ our `Counter` contract. GSN relayers require recipient contracts to have funds since they will then charge the cost of the relayed transaction (plus a fee!) to it. We will again use the `oz-gsn` set of commands to do this. Make sure to replace the recipient address with the address of your `Counter` contract instance.

[source,console]
----
$ npx oz-gsn fund-recipient --recipient 0xCfEB869F69431e42cdB54A4F4f105C19C080A601
----

Cool! Now that we have our GSN-powered contract, and a local GSN to try it out, let's build a small (d)app.

[[creating-the-dapp]]
== Creating the dapp

We will create our (d)app using the `create-react-app` package, which bootstraps a simple client-side application using React.

[source,console]
----
npx create-react-app client
----

On the `client/App.js` file, add the following code. This will use `@openzeppelin/network` to create a new provider connected to the local network. It will use a key generated on the spot to sign all transactions on behalf of the user and will use the GSN to relay them to the network. This allows your users to start interacting with your (d)app right away, even if they do not have MetaMask installed, an Ethereum account, or any ETH at all.

First, create a symlink so we can access our compiled contracts `.json` files. From inside the `src` directory run:

`ln -ns ../../build`

This will allow our front end to reach our contract artifacts.

Then, replace `App.js` in your react project with the following code:

[source,javascript]
----
import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from "react";
import { useWeb3Network } from "@openzeppelin/network";

const PROVIDER_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8545";

function App() {
  // get GSN web3
  const context = useWeb3Network(PROVIDER_URL, {
    gsn: { dev: true }
  });

  const { accounts, lib } = context;

  // load Counter json artifact
  const counterJSON = require("./build/contracts/Counter.json");

  // load Counter Instance
  const [counterInstance, setCounterInstance] = useState(undefined);

  let deployedNetwork = undefined;
  if (
    !counterInstance &&
    context &&
    context.networkId
  ) {
    const deployedNetwork = counterJSON.networks[context.networkId.toString()];
    const instance = new context.lib.eth.Contract(counterJSON.abi, deployedNetwork.address);
    setCounterInstance(instance);
    }
  }

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const getCount = useCallback(async () => {
    if (counterInstance) {
      // Get the value from the contract to prove it worked.
      const response = await counterInstance.methods.value().call();
      // Update state with the result.
      setCount(response);
    }
  }, [counterInstance]);

  useEffect(() => {
    getCount();
  }, [counterInstance, getCount]);

  const { methods } = counterInstance || {};

  const increase = async () => {
    await counterInstance.methods.increase().send({ from: accounts[0] });
    getCount();
  };

  const decrease = async () => {
    await counterInstance.methods.decrease().send({ from: accounts[0] });
    getCount();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h3> Counter counterInstance </h3>
      {lib && !counterInstance && (
        <React.Fragment>
          <div>Contract Instance or network not loaded.</div>
        </React.Fragment>
      )}
      {lib && counterInstance && (
        <React.Fragment>
          <div>
            <div>Counter Value:</div>
            <div>{count}</div>
          </div>
          <div>Counter Actions</div>
          <div>
            <button onClick={() => increase(1)} size="small">
              Increase Counter by 1
            </button>
            <button
              onClick={() => decrease(1)}
              disabled={!(methods && methods.decreaseCounter)}
              size="small"
            >
              Decrease Counter by 1
            </button>
          </div>
        </React.Fragment>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

----


NOTE: You can pass a `dev: true` flag to the `gsn` options when setting up the provider. This will use the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-gsn-provider/[GSNDevProvider] instead of the regular GSN provider. This is a provider set up specifically for testing or development, and it _does not require a relayer to be running_ to work. This can make development easier, but it will feel less like the actual GSN experience. If you want to use an actual require, you can run `npx oz-gsn run-relayer` locally (see the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-gsn-helpers#running-the-relayer-binary[OpenZeppelin GSN helpers] for more info).

Great! We can now fire up our application running `npm start` from within the `client` folder. Remember to keep both your ganache and relayer up and running. You should be able to send transactions to your `Counter` contract without having to use MetaMask or have any ETH at all!

[[moving-to-testnet]]
== Moving to a testnet

It is not too impressive sending a local transaction in your ganache network, where you already have a bunch of fully-funded accounts. To witness the GSN at its full potential, let's move our application to the Rinkeby testnet. If you later want to go onto mainnet, the instructions are the same.

Let's start by deploying our `Counter` contract to Rinkeby. You will need an account with some Rinkeby ETH for this, which you will have to register in your `network.js` file. Take a look at https://docs.openzeppelin.com[this guide] for more info.

[source,console]
----
$ openzeppelin create
✓ Compiled contracts with solc 0.5.9 (commit.e560f70d)
? Pick a contract to instantiate: Counter
? Pick a network: rinkeby
✓ Added contract Counter
✓ Contract Counter deployed
? Do you want to call a function on the instance after creating it?: Yes
? Select which function * initialize()
✓ Setting everything up to create contract instances
✓ Instance created at 0xCfEB869F69431e42cdB54A4F4f105C19C080A601
----


The next step will be to instruct our (d)app to connect to a Rinkeby node instead of to the local network. Change the `PROVIDER_URL` in your `App.js` to do this, using, for instance, an Infura Rinkeby endpoint. At this point, you will also want to pass in a config object as we will be using a real GSN provider rather than our developer environment, and our config options give us more control over things such as the gas price we are willing to pay. For production (d)apps, you will want to configure this to your requirements. 

[source,javascript]
----

import { useWeb3Network, useEphemeralKey } from "@openzeppelin/network";

// inside App.js#App()
const context = useWeb3Network('https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/' + INFURA_API_TOKEN, {
  gsn: { signKey: useEphemeralKey() }
});
----
 
Redeploy using the cli command `oz create`, selecting `Rinkeby` as the network and copy the address returned at the end (you will need it later to fund your contract!).

We are almost there! If you try to use your (d)app now, you will notice that you are not able to send any transactions. This is because your `Counter` contract has not been funded on this network yet. Instead of using the `oz-gsn fund-recipient` command we used earlier, we will now use the https://gsn.openzeppelin.com[online gsn-tool] by pasting in the address of your instance. To do this the web interface requires that you use MetaMask on the Rinkeby Network, which will allow you to deposit funds into your contract.

image::GSNDappTool.png[OpenZeppelin GSN Dapp Tool,500]

That's it! We can now start sending transactions to our `Counter` contract on the Rinkeby network from our browser, without even having MetaMask installed.

[[wrapping-up]]
== Wrapping up

In this example, we have built a GSN-powered (d)app from scratch combining several OpenZeppelin libraries. First, we extended from the OpenZeppelin Contracts to have our contract act as GSN recipients. Then, we used the OpenZeppelin CLI to compile and deploy our contract on a local network. After that, we set up a local GSN (relayer included!) using the `oz-gsn run-relayer` command from `@openzeppelin/gsn-helpers`, and funded our recipient with `oz-gsn fund-recipient`. Once we had our contract set up in our local network, we relied on `create-react-app` to set up a new client-side app and used `@openzeppelin/network` to easily get a web3 GSN provider to start interacting with our contract.

If you want to fast-forward to start building your GSN-powered (d)app right away, make sure to check out our https://docs.openzeppelin.com/starter-kits/2.3/[GSN Starter Kit], which provides you with a ready-to-use project template that combines all of what we have seen on this guide!
