> Command-line interface for the OpenZeppelin smart contract platform.

OpenZeppelin SDK is a platform to develop, deploy and operate smart contract
projects on Ethereum and every other EVM and eWASM-powered blockchain.

This is the repository for the OpenZeppelin commmand-line interface, the
recommended way to use the OpenZeppelin SDK.

## Install

First, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.com/).
Then, install the OpenZeppelin SDK running:

```sh
npm install --global @openzeppelin/cli
```

## Usage

To start, create a directory for the project and access it:

```sh
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Use `npm` to create a `package.json` file:

```sh
npm init
```

And initialize the OpenZeppelin SDK project:

```sh
openzeppelin init my-project
```

Now it is possible to add contracts to the project with the `openzeppelin add` command,
push these contracts to a blockchain network with `openzeppelin push`, use
`openzeppelin deploy` to create instances for these contracts that later can be
upgraded, and many more things.

Run `openzeppelin --help` for more details about this and all the other functions of
the OpenZeppelin CLI.

The
[OpenZeppelin SDK documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/sdk)
explains how to use the `openzeppelin` command-line interface to build a project, to
upgrade contracts and to share packages for other projects to reuse. It also
explains how to operate the project with the OpenZeppelin JavaScript libraries
instead of this `openzeppelin` command.
