= Using Dependencies

In xref:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started], we learned how to set up a new OpenZeppelin project, deploy a simple contract, and upgrade it. Now, we will build a more interesting project with multiple contracts, leveraging the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-ethereum-package[OpenZeppelin Contracts Ethereum Package]. We will learn about *linking Ethereum Packages*, and *writing upgradeable contracts*.

[[what-we-will-build]]
== What We Will Build

We will write a `TokenExchange` contract, that will allow any user to purchase an ERC20 token in exchange for ETH, at a fixed exchange rate. We will write `TokenExchange` ourselves, but leverage the xref:contracts::erc20.adoc[ERC20 implementation] from xref:contracts::index.adoc[*OpenZeppelin Contracts*]

Before we get started, make sure to xref:getting-started.adoc#setting-up-your-project[initialize a new project]:

[source,console]
----
$ mkdir token-exchange && cd token-exchange
$ npm init -y
$ npm install @openzeppelin/cli
$ npx openzeppelin init
----

NOTE: The full code for this project is available in our https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-sdk/tree/release/2.8/examples/linking-contracts[Github repo].

[[linking-the-contracts-ethereum-package]]
== Linking the Contracts Ethereum Package

We will first get ourselves an ERC20 token. Instead of coding one from scratch, we will use the one provided by the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-ethereum-package[OpenZeppelin Contracts Ethereum Package]. An Ethereum Package is a set of contracts set up to be easily included in an OpenZeppelin project, with the added bonus that the contracts' code _is already deployed in the Ethereum network_. This is a more secure code distribution mechanism, and also helps you save gas upon deployment.

NOTE: Check out https://blog.openzeppelin.com/open-source-collaboration-in-the-blockchain-era-evm-packages/[this article] to learn more about Ethereum Packages.

To link the OpenZeppelin Contracts Ethereum Package into your project, simply run the following:

[source,console]
----
$ npx oz link @openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package
----

This command will download the Ethereum Package (bundled as a regular npm package), and connect it to your OpenZeppelin project. We now have all of OpenZeppelin contracts at our disposal, so let's create an ERC20 token!

NOTE: Make sure you install `@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package` and not the vanilla `@openzeppelin/contracts`. The latter is set up for general usage, while `@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package` is tailored for being used with xref:upgrades::index.adoc[OpenZeppelin Upgrades]. This means that its contracts are xref:upgrades::writing-upgradeable.adoc#use-upgradeable-packages[already set up to be upgradeable].

[[creating-an-erc20-token]]
== Creating an ERC20 Token

Let's deploy an ERC20 token contract to our development network. Make sure to xref:learn::deploy-and-interact.adoc#local-blockchain[have a Ganache instance running], or start one by running:

[source,console]
----
$ npx ganache-cli --deterministic
----

For setting up the token, we will be using the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-ethereum-package/blob/master/contracts/presets/ERC20PresetMinterPauser.sol[ERC20PresetMinterPauser implementation] provided by the OpenZeppelin package. We will _initialize_ the instance with the token metadata (name, symbol), and then mint a large initial supply for one of our accounts.

NOTE: The unlocked accounts and transaction hashes may differ from the ones shown here. Run a brand-new Ganache in `--deterministic` mode to get the same ones.

[source,console]

----

Let's break down what we did in the command above. We first chose to create an instance of the `ERC20PresetMinterPauserUpgradeSafe` contract from the `@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package` package we had linked before, and to create it in the local `development` network. We are then instructing the CLI to _initialize_ it with the initial values needed to set up our token. This requires us to choose the appropriate `initialize` function, and input all the required arguments. The OpenZeppelin CLI will then atomically deploy and initialize the new instance in a single transaction.

We now have a working ERC20 token contract in our development network. 

Next we get the accounts we have setup
[source,console]
----
$ npx oz accounts
? Pick a network development

...
----

Then we mint 100 MYT to our default account

----

We can check that the initial supply was properly allocated by using the `balance` command. Make sure to use the address where your ERC20 token instance was created.

[source,console]

100000000000000000000
----

Great! We can now write an exchange contract and connect it to this token when we deploy it.

[[writing-the-exchange-contract]]
== Writing the Exchange Contract

In order to transfer an amount of tokens every time it receives ETH, our exchange contract will need to store the token contract address and the exchange rate in its state. We will set these two values during initialization, when we deploy the instance with `oz deploy`.

Because we're writing upgradeable contracts xref:upgrades::proxies.adoc#the-constructor-caveat[we cannot use Solidity `constructor` s]. Instead, we need to use _initializers_. An initializer is just a regular Solidity function, with an additional check to ensure that it can be called only once.

To make coding initializers easy, xref:upgrades::index.adoc[*OpenZeppelin Upgrades*] provides a base `Initializable` contract, that includes an `initializer` modifier that takes care of this. You will first need to install it:

[source,console]
----
$ npm install @openzeppelin/upgrades
----

Now, let's write our exchange contract in `contracts/TokenExchange.sol`, using an _initializer_ to set its initial state:

[source,solidity]
----
// contracts/TokenExchange.sol
pragma solidity ^0.6.2;

// Import base Initializable contract
import "@openzeppelin/upgrades/contracts/Initializable.sol";

// Import the IERC20 interface and and SafeMath library
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol";


contract TokenExchange is Initializable {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    // Contract state: exchange rate and token
    uint256 public rate;
    IERC20 public token;

    // Initializer function (replaces constructor)
    function initialize(uint256 _rate, IERC20 _token) public initializer {
        rate = _rate;
        token = _token;
    }

    // Send tokens back to the sender using predefined exchange rate
    receive() external payable {
        uint256 tokens = msg.value.mul(rate);
        token.transfer(msg.sender, tokens);
    }
}
----

Note the usage of the `initializer` modifier in the `initialize` method. This guarantees that once we have deployed our contract, no one can call into that function again to alter the token or the rate.

Let's now create and initialize our new `TokenExchange` contract:

[source,console]
----
$ npx oz deploy
✓ Compiled contracts with solc 0.6.7 (commit.b8d736ae)
? Choose the kind of deployment upgradeable
? Pick a network development
? Pick a contract to deploy TokenExchange
✓ Added contract TokenExchange
✓ Contract TokenExchange deployed
All implementations have been deployed
? Call a function to initialize the instance after creating it? Yes
? Select which function initialize(_rate: uint256, _token: address)
? _rate: uint256: 10
? _token: address: 0x59d3631c86BbE35EF041872d502F218A39FBa150
✓ Instance created at 0x67B5656d60a809915323Bf2C40A8bEF15A152e3e
To upgrade this instance run 'oz upgrade'
0x67B5656d60a809915323Bf2C40A8bEF15A152e3e
----

Our exchange is almost ready! We only need to fund it, so it can send tokens to purchasers. Let's do that using the `oz send-tx` command, to transfer the full token balance from our own account to the exchange contract. Make sure to replace the recipient of the transfer with the `TokenExchange` address you got from the previous command.

[source,console]
----
$ npx oz send-tx
? Pick a network development
? Pick an instance ERC20PresetMinterPauserUpgradeSafe at 0x59d3631c86BbE35EF041872d502F218A39FBa150

----

All set! We can start playing with our brand new token exchange.

[[using-our-exchange]]
== Using Our Exchange

Now that we have initialized our exchange contract and seeded it with funds, we can test it out by purchasing tokens. Our exchange contract will send tokens back automatically when we send ETH to it, so let's test it by using the `oz transfer` command. This command allows us to send funds to any address; in this case, we will use it to send ETH to our `TokenExchange` instance:

[source,console]
----
$ npx oz transfer
? Pick a network development
? Choose the account to send transactions from (1) 0xFFcf8FDEE72ac11b5c542428B35EEF5769C409f0
? Enter the receiver account 0x67B5656d60a809915323Bf2C40A8bEF15A152e3e
? Enter an amount to transfer 0.1 ether
✓ Funds sent. Transaction hash: 0xfcd74514cd9629a26ec25f637f5dd958dbdfa151594c1a3a6671dcf1d889a50e
----

NOTE: Make sure you replace the receiver account with the corresponding address where your `TokenExchange` was created.

We can now use `oz balance` again, to check the token balance of the address that made the purchase. Since we sent 0.1 ETH, and we used a 1:10 exchange rate, we should see a balance of 1 MYT (MyToken).

[source,console]
----
$ npx oz balance --erc20 0x59d3631c86BbE35EF041872d502F218A39FBa150
? Enter an address to query its balance 0xFFcf8FDEE72ac11b5c542428B35EEF5769C409f0
? Pick a network development
Balance: 1 MYT
1000000000000000000
----

Success! We have our exchange up and running, gathering ETH in exchange for our tokens. But how can we collect the funds we earned...?

[[upgrading-the-exchange]]
== Upgrading the Exchange

We forgot to add a method to withdraw the funds from the token exchange contract! While this would typically mean that the funds are locked in there forever, we can upgrade the contract with the OpenZeppelin CLI to add a way to collect those funds.

NOTE: While upgrading a contract is certainly useful in situations like this, where you need to fix a bug or add a missing feature, it could still be used to change the rules of the game. For instance, you could upgrade the token exchange contract to alter the rate at any time. Because of this, it is important to have appropriate Project Governance in place.

Let's modify the `TokenExchange` contract to add a `withdraw` method, only callable by an `owner`.

[source,solidity]
----
// contracts/TokenExchange.sol
contract TokenExchange is Initializable {
    uint256 public rate;
    IERC20 public token;
+    address public owner;

    // (existing functions not shown here for brevity)
    
+    function withdraw() public {
+        require(
+            msg.sender == owner,
+            "Address not allowed to call this function"
+        );
+        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
+    }    
}
----

When modifying your contract, you will have to place the `owner` variable *after* the other variables (xref:upgrades::writing-upgradeable.adoc#modifying-your-contracts[learn more] about this restriction). Don't worry if you forget about it, the CLI will check this for you when you try to upgrade.

NOTE: If you are familiar with xref:contracts::index.adoc[*OpenZeppelin Contracts*], you may be wondering why we didn't simply extend from `Ownable` and used the `onlyOwner` modifier. The issue is OpenZeppelin Upgrades does not support extending from now contracts in an upgrade (if they declare their own state variables). Again, the CLI will alert you if you attempt to do this. Refer to the xref:upgrades::writing-upgradeable.adoc#modifying-your-contracts[Upgrades documentation] for more info.

The only thing missing is actually _setting_ the `owner` of the contract. To do this, we can add another function that we will call when upgrading, making sure it can only be called once:

[source,solidity]
----
// contracts/TokenExchange.sol
contract TokenExchange is Initializable {
    uint256 public rate;
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;

    // (existing functions not shown here for brevity)

    function withdraw() public {
        require(
            msg.sender == owner,
            "Address not allowed to call this function"
        );
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

+    // To be run during upgrade, ensuring it can never be called again
+    function setOwner(address _owner) public {
+        require(owner == address(0), "Owner already set, cannot modify!");
+        owner = _owner;
+    }
}
----

First we compile the contract
[source,console]
----
$ npx oz compile
✓ Compiled contracts with solc 0.6.7 (commit.b8d736ae)
----

We can now upgrade our token exchange contract to this new version, and call `setOwner` during the upgrade process. The OpenZeppelin CLI will take care of making the upgrade and the call atomically in a single transaction.

[source,console]
----

- New variable 'address owner' was added in contract TokenExchange in contracts/TokenExchange.sol:1 at the end of the contract.

----

NOTE: You can also upgrade dependencies from an Ethereum Package. Upon a new release of `@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package`, if you want to update your ERC20 to include the latest fixes, you can just `oz link` the new version and use `oz upgrade` to get your instance to the newest code.

[[wrapping-up]]
== Wrapping Up

We have built a more complex setup in this tutorial, and learned several concepts along the way. We introduced https://blog.openzeppelin.com/open-source-collaboration-in-the-blockchain-era-evm-packages/[Ethereum Packages] as dependencies for our projects, allowing us to spin up a new token with little effort.

We also presented some xref:upgrades::writing-upgradeable.adoc[limitations] of xref:upgrades::proxies.adoc[how Upgrades works], such as xref:upgrades::writing-upgradeable.adoc#initializers[initializer methods] as a replacement for constructors, and xref:upgrades::writing-upgradeable.adoc#modifying-your-contracts[preserving the storage layout] when modifying our source code. We also learned how to run a function as a migration when upgrading a contract.
