Multi-package repository for ZeppelinOS [library](https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos/tree/master/packages/lib#readme), [CLI](https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos/tree/master/packages/cli#readme), [vouching](https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos/tree/master/packages/vouching#readme), and [docs](https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos/tree/master/packages/docs#readme).

ZeppelinOS is a platform to develop, manage and operate smart contract applications in Ethereum. It can be used to create smart contract systems that can be fixed and improved over time, enabling developers to opt-in to mutability for their deployed code through [upgradeability patterns](https://blog.zeppelinos.org/proxy-patterns/).

## Getting started

Install ZeppelinOS and setup your project as described in the [Setup guide](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/setup.html).

In order to build an upgradeable application with ZeppelinOS, follow our
[Building upgradeable applications](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/building.html) guide.

If you would like to use the ZeppelinOS EVM packages in your app,
 follow our [Using the stdlib in your app](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/using.html) guide.

If you are interested in deploying your own EVM packages for ZeppelinOS,
see our [Developing a new EVM package](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/developing.html) guide.

Two demo apps based on ZeppelinOS are described in [Basil](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/basil.html) and [Crafty](https://docs.zeppelinos.org/docs/crafty.html).

## Sample

Quick sample on `zos` usage for initializing a project, registering a contract, creating an instance, and upgrading it after changing the original code. 

```sh
npm install --global zos
zos init my-project 0.1.0

vim contracts/MyContract.sol
zos add MyContract
zos session --network ropsten
zos push
zos create MyContract

vim contracts/MyContract.sol
zos push
zos update MyContract
```

## Security

If you find a security issue, please contact us at security@zeppelinos.org. We give rewards for reported issues, according to impact and severity.

## Development setup

This monorepo is managed via [lerna](https://lernajs.io/). To get everything up and running, install lerna 3.x (either globally or locally from the root of the repository), and run `lerna bootstrap`. This will compile all packages, install all dependencies, and create symlinks for local dependencies (for instance, `packages/cli/node_modules/zos-lib` will be symlinked to `packages/lib`).

Note that, since `cli` and `lib` packages need to be precompiled, for any change in `lib` to impact `cli` you'll need to run a new `lerna bootstrap`.
