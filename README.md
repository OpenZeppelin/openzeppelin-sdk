> Formerly known as ZeppelinOS

OpenZeppelin is a platform to develop, deploy and operate smart contract
projects on Ethereum and every other EVM and eWASM-powered blockchain.

This repository includes the OpenZeppelin
[Command-Line Interface](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-sdk/tree/master/packages/cli#readme),
[JavaScript Library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-sdk/tree/master/packages/lib#readme),
and [the sources for the Documentation Website](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-sdk/tree/master/packages/docs#readme).

## Install

First, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.com/).
Then, install the OpenZeppelin SDK running:

```sh
npm install --global @openzeppelin/cli
```

> If you get an `EACCESS permission denied` error while installing, please refer to the [npm documentation on global installs permission errors](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally). Alternatively, you may run `sudo npm install --unsafe-perm --global @openzeppelin/cli`, but this is highly discouraged, and you should rather either use a node version manager or manually change npm's default directory.

## Usage

We recommend to use the OpenZeppelin SDK through the `openzeppelin sdk` command-line interface.

To start, create a directory for the project and access it:

```sh
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Use `npm` to create a `package.json` file:

```sh
npm init
```

And initialize the OpenZeppelin SDK project:

```sh
openzeppelin init my-project
```

Now it is possible to use `openzeppelin create` to create instances for these contracts that 
later can be upgraded, and many more things.

Run `openzeppelin --help` for more details about thes and all the other functions of the
OpenZeppelin CLI.

The
[OpenZeppelin SDK documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/sdk/2.5)
explains how to build a project using our platform, how to upgrade contracts,
how to share packages for other projects to reuse, how to vouch for the quality
of a package, how to use the JavaScript libraries to operate the project, and
it explains details of the platform and some advanced topics.
