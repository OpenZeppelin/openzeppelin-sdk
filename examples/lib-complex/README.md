# OpenZeppelin SDK example: running a published project programatically

**Note: This example is out of date and uses old OpenZeppelin components**

The OpenZeppelin SDK includes a programmatic library named `@openzeppelin/upgrades` that can be used to manage a project from javascript code, instead of via the terminal using the CLI. This sample project shows how to set up a new OpenZeppelin SDK project from scratch, publish it, create new contract instances, and upgrade them.

You can test it out by running `npm test`.
