# Sample ZeppelinOS project with dependencies

This is a simple ZeppelinOS project that uses several dependencies to retrieve contracts and build an application. It relies on `dep-basic` (from this same repository) to use a sample `EthBox` contract, and on [`openzeppelin-zos`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-zos) for a regular `ERC20` contract.

## How this project was set up

To set up a project like this one, you need to first install ZeppelinOS, create a new project, and link all the dependencies you need to use:

```bash
$ npm install -g zos
$ zos init cli-with-deps
$ zos link dep-basic
$ zos link openzeppelin-zos
```

Then add your contracts, and publish the project to a network. In this project, we have a single contract named `TokenExchange`, which depends on an `ERC20` token, and the `EthBox` contract provided by `dep-basic`.
```bash
$ zos add TokenExchange
$ zos session --network ropsten
$ zos push
```

Note that, if you are working on a network where the dependencies have not been deployed by their developer (this happens when working with a local ganache instance, for example), you need to add the `--deploy-libs` flag to the `push` command. This will make ZeppelinOS deploy your own copy of the libraries.

After you have pushed your code to the network, you can now create instances from your own contracts, or from any provided by the dependencies you are working with:
```bash
$ zos create dep-basic/EthBox

```bash
$ zos create openzeppelin-zos/DetailedPremintedToken --init initialize --args $OWNER,Test,TEST,8,100000000000000000000

cli-with-deps TokenExchange proxy: 0x7878793d39e04b0b45bcdfa51d8577629f5e1510
```

You can now spin up a truffle console and start interacting with your newly deployed contracts. Note that all of these are upgradeable instances:
```js
TokenExchange.deployed().then(e => exchange = e)         // Retrieve token exchange contract using .deployed()
exchange.token().then(t => token = ERC20.at(t))          // Retrieve token contract using exchange getter
token.transfer(exchange.address, 10e18, { from: owner }) // Send tokens to the exchange for distribution

exchange.sendTransaction({ from: user, value: 1e17 })    // Make a purchase on the exchange from a user!
```
