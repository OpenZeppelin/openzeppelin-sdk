* OpenZeppelin SDK (oz for short): a platform to develop, deploy and operate smart
  contract projects on Ethereum and every other EVM and eWASM-powered
  blockchain. Avoid: operating system, system, project, application.
* smart contract project (project for short): software project developed with
  the OpenZeppelin SDK. It can be an Ethereum Package, or an application.
  Avoid: application, system, dApp, app.
* application: A group of smart contracts developed with the OpenZeppelin SDK that can
  be upgraded and use Ethereum Packages.
  Avoid: dApp, app, upgradeable application, upgradeable smart contracts.
* Ethereum Packages: smart contracts already deployed to the Ethereum blockchain with
  the OpenZeppelin SDK, available for applications to reuse, and vouched with ZEP tokens.
  Avoid: package, library, stdlib, standard library, on-chain, dependency,
  upgradeable, reusable, framework.
* upgrade: one of the features of the OpenZeppelin SDK. It allows to deploy new versions
  of applications and Ethereum Packages to the blockchain.
  Avoid: mutability, update, new release.
* link: one of the features of the OpenZeppelin SDK. It allows a smart contract to use
  an Ethereum Package.
* vouching: one of the features of the OpenZeppelin SDK. It allows to use ZEP tokens to
  back the quality of an Ethereum Package.
  Avoid: stake.
* ZEP Token (ZEP for short): token of value used to back the quality of an
  Ethereum Package.
  Avoid: token.
* administrator (admin for short): account in control of an application or Ethereum
  Package, that can upgrade them and transfer to a different admin.
  Avoid: upgradeability admin, owner, developer.
